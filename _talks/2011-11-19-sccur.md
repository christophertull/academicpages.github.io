Presented my capstone project for my B.S. in Computer Science: "MindSoccer" which was a project to navigate robotic vehicles using a brain-computer interface. This was my very first conference presentation so I was understandably nervous, but the crowd enjoyed our presentation and the accompanying demonstration with the vehicles and headsets.
