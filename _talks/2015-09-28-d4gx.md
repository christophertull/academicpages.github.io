Co-presented with Dr. Constantine Kontokosta to talk about our [conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Tull/publication/282781435_Web-Based_Visualization_and_Prediction_of_Urban_Energy_Use_from_Building_Benchmarking_Data/links/561c6ab808ae6d17308b1843.pdf). Since we won the 'Best Paper' award, we also got to present the next day at Strata Hadoop World. This was quite fun, and we were set up in the middle of the Expo hall with a large screen. At the last second my advisor got stuck in traffic and couldn't make it so I had to completely 'wing' his portion of the talk. I pulled it off but it was definitely a bit more exciting than I had planned!
