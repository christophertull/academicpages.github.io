Presented on behalf of my coauthors to talk about our [conference paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306219830_How_Much_Water_Does_Turf_Removal_Save_Applying_Bayesian_Structural_Time-Series_to_California_Residential_Water_Demand) on estimating the water savings attributable to turf removal programs. [The workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/2016dsfew/home) was an eclectic mix of topics, mainly from agriculture and water resources. The ag presence was heavy with a large showing from Iowa State and Purdue, likely because these were the institutions of the keynote speakers.
